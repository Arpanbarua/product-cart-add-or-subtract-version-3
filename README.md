I developed this product cart system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, inspired by a real product listing on daraz.com.bd. The project includes:
✅ Display of product name and price.
✅Functionality to add or remove products from the cart.
✅Real-time update of total items and cost.
✅A discount system based on payment method (e.g., bKash and Nagad) — two popular Mobile Financial Services (MFS) in Bangladesh.
